* Custom File
  
Put the custom file in a separate file so that it does not touch
init.el. Only load it when it exists.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))  
#+END_SRC

* Advisor System: el-patch

Provides a way to customize the behavior of Emacs Lisp functions that
do not provide enough variables and hooks to let you customize.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'el-patch)
#+END_SRC
