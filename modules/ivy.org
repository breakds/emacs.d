* Ivy, Counsel and Swiper

There can be some confusion about the naming here. Yes they are 3
packages, but you only need to install =counsel= and it will bring in
=ivy= and =swiper= as dependencies, according to [[https://writequit.org/denver-emacs/presentations/2017-04-11-ivy.html][this]].

Install ivy from git (the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][git repo]] is called swiper).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package counsel
    :diminish ivy-mode
    :straight (counsel :type git :host github :repo "abo-abo/swiper")
    :init (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t
                ivy-count-format "(%d/%d) "
                ivy-height 17)
    :config (ivy-mode 1)
    :bind (("C-s" . swiper-isearch)
           ("M-x" . counsel-M-x)
           ("C-x C-f" . counsel-find-file)
           ("C-x b" . counsel-ibuffer)
           :map minibuffer-local-map
           ("C-r" . counsel-minibuffer-history)))

* Ivy Rich

  According to its [[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][GitHub README]],

  #+begin_quote
  This package comes with rich transformers for commands from ivy and
  counsel. It should be easy enough to define your own transformers
  too.
  #+end_quote


  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ivy-rich
      :straight t
      :init (ivy-rich-mode 1))
  #+end_src
